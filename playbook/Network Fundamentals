Typical size: Small/medium LANs (homes, classrooms, offices).

Why choose it: Simple to design and troubleshoot; easy to scale by adding a port; inexpensive.

Performance: Each edge device gets a dedicated link to the central switch/AP.

Trade-offs: The central device is a single point of failure (mitigate with stackable/dual switches or redundant uplinks).

Great for: Home networks, SMB offices, labs, wired clients behind a single closet switch or a single wireless AP.

Typical size: Medium/large environments requiring high availability and self-healing paths (campuses, warehouses, city-wide Wi-Fi, sensor/IoT networks).

Why choose it: Redundancy & resilience—multiple paths; the network can reroute around failures.

Performance: Excellent fault tolerance; can balance traffic across paths (with the right protocols).

Trade-offs: Complexity & cost—more links/radios, more routing overhead, careful RF/channel planning for wireless mesh; full meshes scale poorly (links grow ~O(n²)).

Great for: Outdoor wireless backhaul, mission-critical networks needing continuous uptime, distributed IoT where cabling is impractical.

Quick rule of thumb

Start with Star for simplicity and cost.

Move to (Partial) Mesh where redundancy, coverage, or no single point of failure is mandatory.

| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary role          | Connect devices within the same network/LAN                                     | Connect different networks (LAN to LAN/WAN/Internet)              |
| OSI focus             | Layer 2 (Ethernet/MAC). Some are multilayer (L3)                                | Layer 3 (IP) and above features                                      |
| Forwarding basis      | MAC address table (learns source MACs, forwards to correct port)                | Routing table (longest-prefix match on IP)                       |
| Broadcast behavior    | One broadcast domain per VLAN; floods unknown unicast/broadcast within VLAN     | Stops broadcasts; doesn’t forward L2 broadcasts between networks |
| Segmentation          | VLANs split a switch into multiple L2 segments                                  | Inter-VLAN routing between those segments                        |
| Default gateway       | Not needed for pure L2 switching                                                | Acts as the default gateway between networks                     |
| NAT & Internet access | Not typical (except on L3/Multi-layer with limited features)                    | NAT/PAT to share public IPs; Internet edge role                  |
| DHCP                  | Often DHCP relay; some smart switches have basic DHCP                           | Frequently DHCP server for LANs                                  |
| Security              | Port security, 802.1X, VLAN ACLs                                                | ACLs, policy-based routing, firewall features, VPN                   |
| Ports/links           | Many Ethernet access ports                                                      | Fewer LAN ports; WAN interfaces (Ethernet, fiber, cellular)      |


Decision guide

Need to add more clients on the same subnet with fast local switching? - Switch.

Need to reach another subnet, route between VLANs, or reach the Internet with NAT? - Router (or an L3 switch configured for routing).

Note: Layer-3 (multilayer) switches blur the line—they switch at L2 and route between VLANs at line-rate. Use them inside campuses; keep a traditional router/firewall at the WAN/Internet edge for NAT, advanced security, and VPN.

Practical examples

Home/Small Office: Star topology: ISP modem/router to switch/AP to PCs/printers. Router does DHCP + NAT; switch/AP provides local connectivity.

Warehouse Wi-Fi: Partial mesh between APs to cover long aisles; controller or mesh protocols handle rerouting if a link drops.

Campus Core: Access switches in star to the distribution/core; L3 switching for inter-VLAN routing; redundant links forming a partial mesh at the core for high availability.
