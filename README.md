## About Me
Hi! My name is Demintrie Graham.  
I’m currently studying Hospitality & Events Management at Hocking College.  
I created this Playbook to document useful processes, knowledge, and best practices that connect to my work, studies, and daily life.  

Fun fact: I’m especially interested in how technology and networks play a role in hospitality and event management.
